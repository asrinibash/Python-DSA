# Taking User Input

# input()
first_num=input("Enter your first num: ") # it takes a argument called "prompt" where we can prompt to user
second_num=input("Enter your second num:")

result=first_num+second_num
print(result)
# if we pass number, the input() takes it as a string only because for generic input

# if get integer from user we need to do type conversion
# what ever we are accepting from user input in python is in string type only.
